# theGuessGame
The GuessGame project is my first big project in which I have created an online version of the boardgame "Mastermind", using JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, PHP and SQL.

In every game, a random combination of 4 colours is automatically created. This is the code to be guessed. These colours can be repeated (or not) and, depending on the difficulty selected by the user, there will be more or less colours available to generate this code. Therefore, the objective of the user is to guess this colour-code in less than 10 rounds.

Furthermore, this web application provides the opportunity to play as logged user. When logged, at the end of every round a punctuation is displayed (based on the time required and the number of rounds played). This punctuation, together with other game statistics, is stored in the data base, which allows the user to keep track of his games. Additionally, this punctuation data is used to create a rank of the logged players, allowing them to compete for the higher positions of the rank.

This project has been upload in a free hosting (without certificate HTTPS!) for testing purposes:
